    <h4> Hello, I'm Noelle, I make beautiful things...</h4>
    <p>As a front end web developer, my goal is to create elegant and efficient web applications. I am a recent graduate of a bootcamp style program at the Iron Yard. I'm constantly exploring new approaches and learning how to make things work as seamlessly as possible. When I'm not coding a pass my time by teaching yoga and reading. I'm always looking for interesting projects to work on, so drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate! </p>

    <h4>My Work</h4>
    <h3> sequence </h3>
    <p>Sequence is an application for yogis. It's a tool for teachers and practitioners to create full length yoga sequences. The app generates a series of yoga poses based on preferences set by the user. Users are able to save their sequences while logged in so they can use them repeatedly. This was my final project at the Iron Yard and it's one I'm always improving.</p>
