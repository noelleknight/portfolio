    <h4> Hello, I'm Noelle, I make beautiful things...</h4>
    <p>As a front end web developer, my goal is to create elegant and efficient web applications. I am a recent graduate of a bootcamp style program at the Iron Yard. I'm constantly exploring new approaches and learning how to make things work as seamlessly as possible. When I'm not coding, I pass my time by teaching yoga and reading. I'm always looking for interesting projects to work on, so drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate! </p>

    <h4>My Work</h4>
    <h3> Sequence </h3>
    <p>Sequence is an application for yogis. It's a tool for teachers and practitioners to create full length yoga sequences. The app generates a series of yoga poses based on preferences set by the user. Users are able to save their sequences while logged in so they can use them repeatedly. This was my final project at the Iron Yard and it's one I'm extremely passionate about as a yogi and developer.</p>

    <h3> Random Repos </h3>
    <p>Random Repos is an application that utilizes the github API in a fun way. By entering a repository name you can see a list of all of the developers associated with it, including their avatars and a link to their GH profile. I utilized the jQuery animation method in this project to add some cool effects to a simple application.

    <h3> Popular Science </h3>
    <p>Popular Science is a simple blogging platform developed as a group project by the five students in my cohort at the Iron Yard. It was built to have a straightforward user interface and make blogging easy and intuitive.
